=== GENERAL INFO
The Visual Studio 2010 solution for ClipUpload 3 has 11 projects associated to it:
 - ClipUpload3: The program itself
 - AddonHelper: This contains a class that is to be inherited by addons for extra helper methods.
 - GlobalHook: Library that handles global Windows hooks.

=== BUILD INFO
Each addon project has been set up to build to the ClipUpload3\bin\Debug\Addons folder. You will probably need to set up every config file yourself in the bin\Debug folder. Get them from your installation, as it's nearly impossible for me to include clean files in this repository :)

=== REGARDING PULL REQUESTS
I am happy to accept pull requests for ClipUpload, however I can not guarantee a new immediate release if it's a minor patch. New addons can be added, but I cant guarantee they'll be in the release itself. You should check out this page: http://wiki.clipupload.net/list-of-addons/download-addons You can get your addon on that page if you shoot me an email with more info about your addon.
